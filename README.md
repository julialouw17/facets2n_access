# facets2n_access
Pipeline to run the FACETS2n algorithm on MSK ACCESS samples. 

FACETS2n, developed by Ryan Ptashkin, is designed to compute copy number estimates using unmatched normal samples to reduce noise in log ratio calculations. See the full documentation for the FACETS2n package here: https://github.com/rptashkin/facets2n.
